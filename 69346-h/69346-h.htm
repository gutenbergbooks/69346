<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>

<small>VEGETABLE DISHES</small></h2>
</div>

<p>There is undoubtedly a great and growing liking
for <i>maigre</i> dishes, not only amongst those people
who eat them from religious motives, but amongst
the general public. Nowadays at most of the
smart restaurants vegetable and cereal dishes are
a feature of almost every meal, and at private
houses no luncheon and few dinner menus are
considered complete unless a vegetable or cereal
dish is included.</p>

<p>But apart from fashion the value of these
dishes is great; they are good for the health and
good for the pocket of the housekeeper, provided
they are ordered with discretion.</p>

<p>In the country, where vegetables are plentiful
and money is not, I have often noticed that sufficient
use is not made of vegetables, while where
fresh green food is a luxury its place is not taken—as
it should be—by such food stuffs as rice,
macaroni, haricot beans and corn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>As the housekeeper whose weekly income is
limited knows only too well, there often comes a
day when the supply of meat falls short. Then
comes the question, can it be eked out in a presentable
manner or must more be bought and the
desired cost exceeded. Now the woman who
caters carefully will realize how such inexpensive
materials as rice or macaroni, potatoes or cabbage
may be pressed into service.</p>

<p>For example, the only available meat dish for
luncheon is a hot pot of mutton and the party is
suddenly augmented. Add to the menu a dish of
macaroni au jus, or a rissole or corn curry, and
supplement the homely pudding with a little
cheese savoury, and what more can any one
desire?</p>

<p>Then if the meat for a veal and ham pie is
scarcely sufficient add a liberal quantity of partly
cooked macaroni cut into short lengths, while
should the quantity of minced mutton available
seem sadly little, add an ample border of savoury
rice or an extra dish of potato and cheese balls.
If rissoles are required add to them by means of
mashed potato or rice.</p>

<p>Then never allow small quantities of cooked
vegetables left over from lunch or dinner to be
thrown away. Place them on clean plates in the
larder; they will prove useful additions to the
next day’s bill of fare.</p>

<p>For example, you have two or three young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
carrots, a cupful of peas, even a smaller quantity
of broad beans. Slice the carrots and arrange all
three vegetables in china shells, mask with mayonnaise
sauce, sprinkle with coralline pepper, and
serve with cold meat, or reheat them by steaming,
place them in a hot fireproof dish, cover with
boiling hot maître d’hôtel sauce, and garnish with
rolls of bacon, and serve as a luncheon dish; or
add a little onion and use for a vegetable curry,
and serve surrounded by well-boiled rice; or reheat,
mix with parsley and butter sauce, cover
with mashed potato, score the top and brown in
the oven, and serve for luncheon in the guise of
vegetable pie.</p>

<p>If some new potatoes are left over, slice, fry,
and serve with or without bacon for breakfast;
while should you have some old boiled potatoes
to use up they may be mashed and employed in
half a score of ways; incorporated with cabbage,
pepper, salt, and a little butter, formed into
cakes, and fried to serve with bacon, grilled
chicken or ham, for instance.</p>

<p>Thus the clever housekeeper economizes and
yet does not allow her economies to be apparent.</p>

<p>Before passing on to the recipes which are the
<i>raison d’être</i> of this little volume, I would say a
word on the treatment of vegetables.</p>

<p>It is the habit of gardeners to pick fruit, vegetables,
etc., in the morning, and to bring in the
day’s supply at about eleven o’clock, and on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
Saturday to provide sufficient for two days’ consumption.
Except in the case of strawberries
(which should be gathered, if possible, on the day
on which they are to be eaten) and asparagus
(which is infinitely better when cut just before
the time for cooking), there is no objection to this
plan, provided the garden produce is stored in the
best manner. Carrots and turnips, leeks and
onions should be placed in wire racks; and lettuces
should be arranged root-end downmost in
a shallow pan of fresh water. Cabbages and
cauliflower may be treated likewise. Parsley
should be placed in water as if it were a flower—not
soused head over heels in that liquid.
Whether the stalk-end of a cucumber should be
placed in water, or whether the vegetable should
be left dry in a cool, airy place, is a moot point.
I do not feel competent to say which course
should be followed, but my cook, who is clever at
cooking vegetables, opines that cucumbers should
not be placed in water; and, in any case, that
they should not be kept long when cut.</p>

<p>Mustard-and-cress should be arranged in a
shallow pan of water.</p>

<p>Peas and broad beans should not be shelled
unnecessarily long before eating, and if it is
necessary to keep them they should be placed in a
wire rack in a cool, well-ventilated place.</p>

<p>All vegetables should be eaten while young, or
they lose considerably in flavour. When French<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
or runner beans are quite young it is better merely
to remove the strings and to cook them whole;
but when old age approaches they are more
palatable when sliced.</p>

<h3>To Boil Vegetables</h3>

<p>When boiling vegetables remember that all
fresh vegetables should be plunged into boiling
salted water, the proportions being 1 tablespoonful
of salt to 1 gallon of water.</p>

<p>Dried vegetables should be placed in lukewarm
water.</p>

<p>A piece of sugar put into the water in which
green vegetables are cooked helps to bring out
the flavour.</p>

<p>Leave the cover off the pan in which vegetables
are cooked, or, at all events, leave it half off, so
that the steam can escape easily.</p>

<p>Do not allow vegetables to stay in the water
in which they are boiled, but drain them at once,
pressing out all the water possible.</p>

<p>Green vegetables take on an average about 20
minutes to cook, though 10 minutes is often long
enough for young peas, while cabbages sometimes
take nearly an hour.</p>

<p>The best way of cooking peas is as follows:—Shell
a pint of peas and place them in a jar with
a closely-fitting lid, put in with them a saltspoonful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
of salt, a tablespoonful of butter, a teaspoonful of
powdered white sugar, a sprig of mint and a shake
of black pepper. Cover the jar closely and place
it in a saucepan of boiling water. Boil briskly,
until done, which should be in ½ an hour to ¾ of
an hour.</p>

<h3>Peas with Béchamel Sauce (Hot)</h3>

<p>Cook the peas as in the preceding recipe, and
just before serving pour over them a small quantity
of Béchamel sauce.</p>

<h3>Petit Pois au Beurre (Hot)</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Peas with Butter</i></p>

<p>Having cooked the peas either by the method
described above or having boiled them in the
ordinary way, drain off the water and shake the
peas to dry them well, return them to the hot
dry pan they were cooked in, and at the last
moment before serving throw in a pat of butter,
let this just melt, and serve.</p>

<h3>French Beans</h3>

<p class="center"><i>À la Crême de Fromage</i> (<i>Hot</i>)</p>

<p>Cook the beans in the usual way by throwing
them in boiling salted water in which a teaspoonful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
of sugar has been placed. If young, cook
them whole, only removing the spines and pointed
end, or if stock can be used, place them in a pan
which has been buttered, sprinkle them with salt,
and just cover them with stock. When tender
place them on a hot dish, make a white sauce with
½ oz. of butter and ½ oz. of flour mixed with ½
pint of the stock in which the beans have been
cooked, add a good pinch of salt and stir well,
adding one well-beaten egg and two tablespoonsful
of finely-grated cheese. Do not let the sauce
boil after the egg has been added or it will curdle.
Pour round the beans and serve.</p>

<p>French beans can also be served with Béchamel
sauce or quite plainly with a small quantity
of butter melted and run over them, with a shake
of pepper and salt, or again with a plain melted
butter sauce.</p>

<h3>Flageolets</h3>

<p>Flageolets are the beans of the kidney bean,
French bean, etc., and when shelled and cooked
in various ways are excellent eating. They should
be boiled in the same way as peas, simply omitting
the sprig of mint, and can be served in various
ways.</p>

<h3>Flageolets au Beurre (Hot)</h3>

<p>Having boiled and drained the beans, place a
pat of butter in the saucepan just before serving.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span></p>

<h3>Flageolets au Maître d’Hôtel (Hot)</h3>

<p>Make a butter by mixing 1 oz. of butter, the
juice of ½ a lemon, a teaspoonful of chopped
parsley, a pinch of salt and pepper, mix well and
form into a pat. When the beans are cooked and
drained, place this with them, shake and serve.</p>

<h3>Flageolets à la Crême de Fromage (Hot)</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>With Cheese Sauce</i>)</p>

<p>Follow the directions for French beans, substituting
flageolets, and boiling in the ordinary
way.</p>

<h3>Cabbage with Cheese Sauce (Hot)</h3>

<p>Boil a cabbage, cut it in 8 pieces, then place
it in 1 pint of cheese sauce, make it thoroughly
hot, and serve with the sauce poured over it.</p>

<h3>Cabbage à la Crême (Hot)</h3>

<p>Drain a boiled cabbage, cut it up small, put it
into a saucepan with 1 oz. of butter, 1 gill of
cream, and a seasoning of pepper and salt, stir it
all together over the fire till thoroughly hot, then
turn it out on to a hot dish, and serve with fried
croûtons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span></p>

<h3>Brussels-Sprouts</h3>

<p>can be served in various ways. For au beurre
after boiling, drain well, taking great care to
squeeze every drop of water possible from the
sprouts, return to the pan and toss in butter,
and dust with pepper and salt.</p>

<h3>Brussels-Sprouts à la Maître d’Hôtel (Hot)</h3>

<p>Follow the above recipe, substituting maître
d’hôtel butter for ordinary butter.</p>

<h3>Brussels-Sprouts au Jus (Hot) with Stock</h3>

<p>Blanch the sprouts, by dipping them in boiling
water and letting them remain in it for a few
minutes. Remove them and drain well, placing
them in a pan with just enough stock to cover
them. Simmer until tender, drain and serve.</p>

<h3>Boiled Nettles (Hot)</h3>

<p>Choose very young nettles, and wash them
well in two or three waters; chop them up very
fine, and put them into a stewpan with a little
water, and steam until quite tender. Meanwhile
toast as many slices of bread as required, trim
these neatly, lay them on a hot dish, drain the
nettles well, serve on the hot toast, dusted with
pepper and salt, and serve with a beurre fondue
sauce, made as follows:—Put 2 oz. of butter into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
a clean saucepan with ½ a teaspoonful of salt, and
half as much pepper, and 1 dessertspoonful of
lemon juice; stir these all together over the fire
until half melted, take it off the fire and continue
stirring until the butter is all dissolved.</p>

<h3>Stewed Nettles (Hot)</h3>

<p>Wash the shoots and young leaves of nettles
very thoroughly in slightly salted water, dry well
and mince very finely. Put this into a stewpan
with 1 tablespoonful of finely-chopped onion, a
suspicion of brown sugar, season with pepper and
salt to taste, pour in a little stock or water, and
stew gently at the side of the fire until quite tender;
then mix together 1 oz. of butter and 1 teaspoonful
of salt, till perfectly smooth, add this to
the nettles, with ½ a tablespoonful of thick cream
or new milk, stir it all well together till quite hot,
and serve on slices of hot toast. If liked, the
onion may be omitted, when the nettles are
treated exactly like spinach.</p>

<h3>Purée of Watercress (Hot)</h3>

<p>Wash some watercress well, getting rid of all
faded or discoloured parts, then put it on in
plenty of boiling salted water, and boil it till
almost cooked; lift it out, and drain on a sieve
or colander to get rid of as much water as possible.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
Meanwhile melt about 1½oz. of butter in
a pan, put the watercress on in this, sprinkle it
lightly with flour, and stir it all together over the
fire for about 10 minutes, then add about 2 gills
of good stock, season with pepper and salt;
cook it for 10 minutes longer, stirring it continuously,
rub it through a sieve and serve very hot,
garnished with quartered hard-boiled eggs, and
fried croûtons.</p>

<h3>Stewed Lettuce</h3>

<p>Treat exactly as in the previous recipe.</p>

<h3>Purée of Turnip Tops</h3>

<p>Proceed as for watercress or lettuce.</p>

<h3>Cauliflower with Tomato Sauce (Hot)</h3>

<p>Clean and soak the cauliflower in salt and water
for 1 hour, then plunge it into boiling water, returning
it again to cold water. After this put it
in a pan of boiling water slightly salted (½ oz. of
salt to 1 gallon of water) and boil it until tender,
20 to 25 minutes. In the meantime make ½ pint
of tomato purée by the following recipe, and
when the cauliflower is cooked place it on a hot
dish, pour the purée over it, sift some finely-grated
brown crumbs over it and serve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span></p>

<h3>Tomato Purée</h3>

<p>Six smallish tomatoes. Cut them into slices
and place them in an enamelled saucepan, add
1 oz. of butter, a teaspoonful of chopped parsley,
salt, pepper, and a tiny pinch of cayenne. Pour
over one pint of stock. Boil until quite soft, and
then pass through a sieve, add 1 oz. of anchovy
essence, thicken with ½ oz. of butter and ½ oz. of
flour previously mixed together in another pan
with some of the tomato mixture. Stir over the
fire until the sauce thickens, and it is then ready
for use.</p>

<h3>Cauliflower Fritters (Hot)</h3>

<p>Break a cooked cauliflower up into neat pieces,
dip these in frying batter till well covered, and
fry in boiling fat. Drain them well, sprinkle
with grated Parmesan cheese and coralline pepper.
Serve at once on a napkin.</p>

<p>This is an excellent way of serving cauliflower
which has been left over.</p>

<h3>Cauliflower au Gratin</h3>

<p>Boil the cauliflower as before, place it in a fireproof
dish, pour over it an ample quantity of
cheese sauce, sprinkle with grated cheese and
brown crumbs and bake until slightly brown on
the top. For cheese sauce see the recipe for
French beans à la crême de fromage (page <a href="#Page_12">12</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span></p>

<h3>Cauliflower with Soubise Sauce</h3>

<p>Boil the cauliflower, place in a fireproof dish.
Cover with delicate onion sauce (Soubise sauce,
p. <a href="#Page_47">47</a>), sprinkle with brown crumbs and make
very hot in the oven.</p>

<h3>Spinach Patties (Hot)</h3>

<p>Take 1 lb. of spinach leaves, pick and wash
them well, and after this blanch them by plunging
them for 5 or 6 minutes in boiling water, drain
them and place them in cold water, remove, press,
and strain, to get rid of as much moisture as
possible. Chop them up, place in a stewpan a
pinch of salt and sugar, ½ oz. of butter and ¼ oz.
of flour, and after stirring this for a few minutes
add the spinach. Stir for 5 minutes then add
¼ pint of milk, stir for a few minutes longer, and
then add ½ pint of milk, stirring steadily until the
liquid is almost dried up. Remove from the pan
and pass through a sieve, then return to the fire
and add a small pat of butter and keep very hot.
Have ready the required number of pastry patty
cases. Quickly make some buttered egg, place
some of the spinach in each case, with a spoonful
of buttered egg on the top, and serve at once very
hot.</p>

<h3>Spinach and Tomatoes (Hot)</h3>

<p>Prepare the spinach as in the preceding recipe.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
Bake six small tomatoes carefully in the oven
with a piece of butter on each. When ready
arrange the spinach in a dish in the form of a
border, place the tomatoes in the centre and
serve.</p>

<h3>Épinards (Spinach) à la Crême (Hot)</h3>

<p>Wash the spinach in six or seven waters, so as
to prevent its being gritty; put it in a saucepan
on the fire, with a very little water and salt;
when done strain very dry and chop it up very
fine. Warm 2 oz. of butter in a stewpan, put the
spinach in, stir till the moisture quite evaporates,
then add a very little salt, a tiny pinch of
sugar (a very little nutmeg, if liked), a pinch of
flour, and 1 large tablespoonful of cream, and
let the whole simmer for a quarter of an hour.
Then put through a sieve and keep hot. In
the meantime, fry in fat some bread cut into
fingers, about 2½ in. long and ½ in. square, and
plant them in little rows all over the spinach
when dished.</p>

<p>Spinach cooked thus is delicious and a very
different matter from the stringy green mass
generally served.</p>

<h3>Turnip Tops à la Crême</h3>

<p>Cook as in the previous recipe for spinach.</p>

<p>Almost any greens, including cabbage and
Brussels-sprouts, are excellent when served thus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span></p>

<h3>Asparagus.</h3>

<p>Asparagus is really almost at its best served
plain boiled with oiled butter; but when it first
comes in, the big kind, which is best for boiling,
is rather expensive, and few people seem to know
how good the more “grasslike” kind is if treated
properly.</p>

<h3>Boiled Asparagus (Hot)</h3>

<p>Although every one will at once say they know
how asparagus should be boiled, yet it is a melancholy
fact that it is not by any means an invariable
rule to find this vegetable properly treated.
If, however, the following directions are carried
out the result is certainly worth the little extra
trouble. Cut the stalks of a bundle of fresh
asparagus evenly and tie them up into a bunch,
put them upright into a pan just large enough to
hold them comfortably and with boiling water to
within about 3 in. of the tops. Keep them on
the fire for from 30 to 40 minutes, then lift them
out, drain well, remove the string, and dish them
on a neatly folded napkin or square of toast.
Treated in this way, the heads are not so apt to
come off, and the stalks, instead of being tough,
are quite tender and eatable. Excellent asparagus
cookers are now made, but if one of these is
not to hand its lack will not be felt if the instructions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
already given are observed. Asparagus
should be served with</p>

<h3>Plain Oiled Butter, or Beurre Fondu,</h3>

<p>which is made as follows:—Put 2 oz. of fresh butter
into a pan with 1 saltspoonful of salt, ½ a saltspoonful
of pepper, and ½ a tablespoonful of
lemon juice; stir this over the fire with a clean
wooden spoon till the butter has rather more
than half melted; then lift it off the fire, and
continue the stirring until the butter is entirely
melted, when it will have a creamy taste, quite
different from the ordinary oiled butter.</p>

<h3>Asparagus au Jus (Hot)</h3>

<p>Cut the young, green, small asparagus diagonally
into equal lengths (like French beans), and
toss these lightly in bacon fat; when slightly
crisped, season with white pepper, salt, minced
parsley, and chervil, and add a little stock;
simmer gently till cooked. Now add a spoonful
or so of good beef or mutton gravy, and serve.
The great secret of this dish is only to put in
enough stock in the first instance to cook the
asparagus, for it should all be absorbed by the
time you add the gravy.</p>

<h3>Asparagus Sprue à la Pompadour (Hot)</h3>

<p>Steam the sprue, or small asparagus, in boiling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
salted water (<i>see</i> p. <a href="#Page_21">21</a>), cut into lengths as above,
and let them dry in a well-heated napkin, in a
warm place, to keep hot. Meanwhile stir together
some fresh butter, the yolk of 1 or more
eggs, a spoonful of vinegar, a dust of salt, and
some freshly-ground black pepper; stand the
pan containing this in another pan half-full of
boiling water, and stir it over the fire till thoroughly
blended. Place the asparagus in the dish,
pour the sauce over it, and serve.</p>

<h3>Iced Asparagus</h3>

<p>For this the large asparagus is required. When
cooked lay on ice or keep in an ice cave. Serve
in an entrée dish and hand very cold mayonnaise
sauce.</p>

<small>VEGETABLE DISHES</small></h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Continued</i>)</p>
</div>

<h3>Potatoes</h3>

<p>A favourite kitchen superstition is that which
forbids the use of left-over potatoes. For many
dishes cooked potato is required. Why then
cook fresh potatoes for the purpose and thereby
waste time and money?</p>

<p>The sensible cook keeps all left-over potato,
and makes use of it in some of the ways here
described.</p>

<h3>Potato Croquettes (Hot)</h3>

<p>Take 1 lb. of cold cooked potato and place in
a mortar. Mash it until all the lumps have
disappeared, add a pat of butter and enough
milk or cream to make the potato soft, and of
the right consistency to form into balls, add a
tablespoonful of chopped parsley, a very small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
quantity of chives (if liked), mix well and form
into balls. Coat them with egg, roll them in
finely-grated breadcrumbs, fry a golden brown,
drain and serve.</p>

<h3>Potatoes à la Crême (Hot)</h3>

<p>Having washed and peeled the number of
potatoes required, cut them into very thin slices
and as much the same size as possible. Place
them in cold water for ½ hour, then drain them
and dry on a soft clean cloth. Have ready a
fireproof dish with a closely-fitting lid, butter the
bottom and sides of it, and place a layer of potatoes
in it, laying them to overlap each other,
and also to stand round the sides, place on these
a layer of soft butter, and a sprinkling of salt,
and continue in this way until the dish is full,
ending with a layer of butter. Place the lid on
firmly, and place the dish in a moderate (350
deg.) oven for ¾ of an hour.</p>

<h3>Cheese Potatoes (Hot)</h3>

<p>Follow the previous recipe, the only difference
being that grated cheese should be sprinkled
between each layer of potato in addition to the
butter.</p>

<h3>Potatoes à la Crême (Hot)</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>A Method of Using up left-over new Potatoes</i>)</p>

<p>Put into a pan from ½ to 1 oz. of butter, add a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
good dessertspoonful of flour, some parsley and
minced chives, with salt, pepper, and a dust of
nutmeg to taste; when the whole is smoothly
blended, pour in sufficient single cream or new
milk, and stir it all together till it boils up,
then add as many cold, cooked new potatoes as
you want, and allow them to heat thoroughly in
the sauce without actually boiling, which would
break them; serve with a dust of coralline pepper.</p>

<h3>Potatoes au Gratin (Hot)</h3>

<p>Well butter a gratin dish, and dust it liberally
with minced parsley, white and coralline pepper,
and, if liked, a little grated Parmesan; cover
this with a layer of thinly sliced, cold, cooked
new potatoes, moistening them as you do so with
a little cream, milk, or, failing either of these,
a little oiled butter, dusting the whole with
minced parsley, pepper, salt, and a very little
cheese; repeat these layers till the dish is full,
finishing with a very light sprinkling of fine white
breadcrumbs, a little spice, grated cheese, and,
lastly, some tiny morsels of fresh butter, and
bake till the surface is nicely covered.</p>

<h3>Potato and Cabbage Cakes</h3>

<p>Take any cold potato and cabbage, mash it
smoothly together, adding beaten egg, white<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
sauce, or melted butter to moisten. Flavour
rather highly with pepper, add a little salt. Form
into round cakes, flour, and bake or fry.</p>

<h3>Curried Potato Cakes</h3>

<p>Have ready some curry sauce with which to
moisten the mashed potato, and proceed as
before.</p>

<h3>Potato Cromeskies (with Mushroom)</h3>

<p>Have ready some well-flavoured mushrooms
stewed in white sauce (the mushrooms cut into
small pieces). Make some smoothed mashed
potato and add to it a beaten yolk of egg. Form
balls of the potato. Hollow out a place in each,
fill with the mushroom mixture. Cover with
more potato, egg, crumb, fry and serve very hot.</p>

<h3>Potato Mould (Hot)</h3>

<p>Mash 1 lb. of well-boiled potatoes with the
same quantity of boiled mashed carrot, pass
through a fine wire sieve, mix all well together
with warm milk, and a lump of butter; place in
a buttered mould, and set in a hot oven for 10
minutes, turn out on a hot dish, and brown in
the oven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span></p>

<h3>Artichokes au Gratin (Hot)</h3>

<p>Wash and peel the artichokes and place them
in cold salted water, then put them in a pan full
of boiling salted water. Boil for 20 minutes. (If
the artichokes are old they should be put into
cold water, which must be brought to the boil
and kept so until they are cooked.) Take the
artichokes out and drain them, cut into pieces,
then place them in a fireproof dish, covering them
with a good white sauce. Sprinkle with grated
cheese. Place in a moderate oven, and bake
about 10 to 15 minutes until of a golden brown.</p>

<h3>Scalloped Artichokes</h3>

<p>Cook as in the previous recipe, but omit the
cheese and bake in shells which have been buttered
and sprinkled with brown crumbs. Sprinkle
the artichoke mixture with crumbs also, place
a little butter on the top and brown as before.</p>

<h3>Artichoke Soufflé</h3>

<p><i>See</i> page <a href="#Page_48">48</a>.</p>

<h3>Artichoke Chips</h3>

<p>Cook as before; slice, fry in boiling fat. Drain
and leave till cold. Fry, drain, and serve very
hot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span></p>

<h3>Cream of Artichokes (Hot or Cold)</h3>

<p>Boil 1 lb. of artichokes until quite tender, then
pass them through a sieve. Make a custard with
½ pint of milk and the yolks of four eggs, pepper
and salt. Whisk up the white of 1 egg, and
whisk this into the custard, mix it with the
artichoke and place all in a well-buttered mould
and steam for an hour. Serve hot with anchovy
sauce, or set the mould on ice, and when quite cold
turn it out on to a dish and serve with iced
mayonnaise of hollandaise sauce.</p>

<h3>Eggs and Artichokes (Hot)</h3>

<p>Boil 8 artichokes and cut them into slices,
place them in a fireproof dish. Hard boil 4 eggs.
When cold shell them and chop them up, place
the eggs on the top of the sliced artichokes, and
pour over the whole a good white sauce flavoured
with Parmesan cheese. Dust over with breadcrumbs
and make thoroughly hot in the oven.</p>

<h3>Bouchées d’Artichauts (Hot)</h3>

<p>Prepare the green artichokes by cutting off the
leaves close down to the fond and trim off any that
may adhere, cut off the stalk as closely as possible.
Plunge the artichoke bottoms into boiling salted
water, and leave them for five minutes, then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
take them out and remove the choke. Place
in boiling water and boil them until tender.
When cooked take them out, drain them, and
put them through a sieve, season with pepper
and salt, moistening the whole with enough white
sauce to make a purée. Have ready some pastry
patty cases, ready cooked, fill each with the
mixture, and serve very hot.</p>

<h3>Fonds Artichauts au Gratin (Hot)</h3>

<p>Boil the artichoke bottoms in the manner described
above, mash them and season with pepper
and salt, adding a little cream and butter, place
some of the mixture in china shells or small fireproof
dishes, grate some cheese over each, and
bake in the oven until a golden brown.</p>

<h3>Stuffed Artichokes.</h3>

<p>Take the cooked artichoke bottoms and fill
with mashed potato flavoured with cheese.
Brown in the oven and serve with cheese sauce.</p>

<h3>Artichokes with Cream Cheese</h3>

<p>Fill the artichoke bottoms with cream of cheese
(<i>see</i> page <a href="#Page_71">71</a>), and serve on buttered toast very
hot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span></p>

<h3>Mushrooms au Gratin (Hot)</h3>

<p>Peel the mushrooms and cut off their stalks,
and place them in a buttered fireproof dish. Peel
the stalks and wash them, add the peelings, dry
them and cut them up. Make a sauce with 1 oz.
of butter, and when melted add ½ oz. of flour,
stirring into it ½ pint of milk. Stir well, bring to
the boil, and then throw in the chopped stalks,
a dessertspoonful of finely-chopped parsley, a teaspoonful
of finely-chopped onion, a dusting of
pepper, and ½ a teaspoonful of salt. Simmer the
sauce until it thickens, strain and add some
browning. Pour the sauce over the mushrooms,
sprinkle some browned breadcrumbs over the
whole, and bake in a quick oven for 10 minutes.</p>

<h3>Mushroom Croûtes (Hot)</h3>

<p>Cut some rounds of bread about ¾ of an inch
thick and scoop them out rather thinner in the
centre, fry until a golden brown, drain, and keep
hot. Place the required number of mushrooms on
a greased baking-tin with a piece of butter in
each, and place in the oven to cook. In the meantime
mince one or two mushrooms and place them
in a pan with a small quantity of good brown
sauce. When cooked place a spoonful on each
croûte, and a whole mushroom on the top of each.
Serve very hot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span></p>

<h3>Roes and Mushrooms on Toast (Hot)</h3>

<p>Make the necessary number of round croûtons
of lightly-fried bread, and choose a like number
of mushrooms the same size as the croûtons.
Peel the mushrooms, rinse them in warm water,
to remove any grit, and remove the stalks. Place
them on a greased baking sheet, stalk side uppermost.
Put some small pieces of butter on each
mushroom and a little pepper and salt. Cover
with buttered paper and cook in a moderate
oven for 10 to 20 minutes. Serve a mushroom
on each croûton, and on each mushroom place a
cooked bloater roe curled round.</p>

<h3>Stuffed Aubergines (Egg Fruit)</h3>

<p>Boil the aubergines until tender (25 to 30
minutes), and then half them lengthwise. Scoop
out the pulp carefully, sieve it, and mix it with
some fine brown crumbs (about a dessertspoonful
to each half-pint), pepper, salt, and some oiled
butter. Fill the skins with this mixture, sprinkle
with crumbs and oiled butter, and bake in a
moderate oven until browned.</p>

<h3>Tomatoes au Gratin (Hot)</h3>

<p>Take four tomatoes as nearly the same size as
possible, and a slice off the top of each. Scoop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
out the middle of the tomato as much as possible,
leaving the frames for cases. These set on one
side. Work the pulp through a sieve, and mix
into it a heaped-up tablespoonful of finely-grated
breadcrumbs, add the yolks of 2 eggs, and mix
well. Fill the tomato cases, heaping the mixture
up, grate a layer of cheese over them, place on a
buttered baking dish and bake for 10 minutes.</p>

<h3>Tomato Pie (Hot)</h3>

<p>Slice a good-sized onion thinly, blanch it, and fry
in fat till lightly browned. Take 1 lb. of ripe tomatoes,
skin and cut in slices. Place a layer of onions
in the bottom of the pie dish with a good seasoning
of salt and pepper, then a layer of tomatoes,
with white breadcrumbs scattered over and a
few pieces of butter, and so on until the dish is
almost full. Have ready some well-mashed
potatoes, and spread thickly over so as to form a
crust, and bake until brown.</p>

<h3>Tomatoes à la Crême de Fromage (Cold)</h3>

<p>Whip ½ pint of cream until stiff, season it
with celery salt and pepper. Add 3 oz. of grated
cheese, then whisk in by degrees ¼ pint of cool
but liquid aspic jelly, which has been flavoured
with tarragon vinegar. Continue to whisk until
the mixture begins to stiffen. Previously peel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
and halve some small round tomatoes, and remove
the seeds from the halves when cut
open, and drain for a little. Place each piece
of tomato, when filled, on a cheese biscuit, and
ornament it round the edge with a piping of
cheese cream. Garnish the dish with cress, and
put a tiny bunch into the middle of the cream
with which the tomatoes are filled.</p>

<h3>Tomato Canapés (Cold)</h3>

<p>Cut some slices of bread 2½ in. in diameter,
and ⅛ in. thick. Soak in milk and then fry a pale
colour. Spread when cold with grated cheese and
butter made into a paste. Dip some small
tomatoes into hot water, skin them and put one
on each piece of bread, placing some finely-minced
parsley and grated Parmesan on each.</p>

<h3>Beignets of Vegetable Marrow (Hot)</h3>

<p>Peel the vegetable marrow and strain it
without removing the seeds. When three-parts
cooked, take it out of the pan and cut it into neat
pieces, as much one size as possible, remove the
seeds, dip each piece of marrow into batter and
fry until a golden brown in boiling fat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span></p>

<h3>To Make the Batter</h3>

<p>Whip two eggs and mix them with about two
tablespoonsful of flour. This is generally sufficient
to make a stiff batter. Then add by degrees
⅓ of a pint of milk, salt and pepper, cover and
put by for an hour or two. Be sure that the
article to be fried is quite dry before being dipped
in the batter.</p>

<h3>Salsify Scallops (Hot)</h3>

<p>Boil the salsify for 50 minutes, then place in a
mortar and mash to a pulp, add a few drops of
anchovy essence and some milk or cream, to make
it the consistency of a thick custard. Place the
mixture in buttered shells, sprinkle some finely-grated
breadcrumbs over it, place a piece of
butter on each and brown in the oven.</p>

<h3>Salsify Fritters (Hot)</h3>

<p>1½ lb. salsify, 2 oz. beef dripping, lemon juice.
Wash and lightly scrape the salsify roots and
put them in cold water. Put the dripping, a
little salt, and the lemon juice in a saucepan with
enough water to cover the salsify. When it boils
put in the roots and let them simmer gently until
they are tender. This will take 30 to 40 minutes.
Do not cover the pan. When tender drain off the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
water and cut the roots into pieces about 2½
in. long. Sprinkle the salsify with a little
pepper, oil, and vinegar, and then dip the pieces
into batter. Fry in boiling fat until a golden
brown, then take out, drain and serve.</p>

<h3>Glazed Carrots (Hot)</h3>

<p>Blanch some small, young carrots, as much of a
size as possible, dry them well, and if necessary,
trim them evenly; put them into a pan, with just
enough stock to cover, and a lump of loaf sugar;
boil them up sharply till the stock is reduced to a
glaze, then add to this 1½ oz. of butter and a
seasoning of salt, and stir them in this till the
liquid is all absorbed, and the carrots are quite
glazed with the butter.</p>

<h3>Carrots à la Flamande (Hot)</h3>

<p>Take about 12 young carrots, blanch them in
scalding water, and rub them well. Then put
them into a stewpan with about 1 oz. of butter,
a saltspoonful of castor sugar, some finely-minced
parsley, a seasoning of pepper and salt,
and sufficient water to cover them liberally;
simmer the carrots in this for about 15 to 20
minutes, when they should be quite tender,
shaking them once or twice in the process.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
Remove the pan from the fire, and stir in the yolk
of 1 egg beaten up with 2 spoonsful of cream or
new milk, and serve very hot.</p>

<h3>Glazed Turnips (Hot)</h3>

<p>Peel about 1 lb. of young turnips, wash them
well, cut into quarters, and put them on in salted
water; bring this sharply to the boil, then place
them in a well-buttered small frying or sauté pan,
sprinkle them liberally with castor sugar, and
directly the turnips begin to colour pour a little
stock in, and season with pepper and salt, and
a little more sugar if liked; let them stew slowly
till quite tender, and serve them with the sauce
poured over them.</p>

<h3>Turnips à la Poulette (Hot)</h3>

<p>Peel about 1 lb. of young, fresh turnips, wash
them well, trim into olive or pear shapes; put
them on in cold, salted water, and bring them
sharply to the boil; then drain them, rinse in
cold water, and dry them in a clean napkin.
Have ready some velouté (i.e. melted butter made
with 1 oz. of butter, 1½ oz. of flour, and about ¾
pint of vegetable stock instead of water), drop
the turnips into this, and cook them till ready,
very gently, for about 20 to 25 minutes according
to size. When ready lift them out, and keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
hot. Add a spoonful of castor sugar to the liquor,
boil it up sharply, and just before serving stir in
the yolk of an egg and a little piece of butter cut
up small; do not let the sauce reboil after adding
these; season to taste with pepper and salt,
pour the sauce on to the turnips, and serve very
hot.</p>

<h3>Onions au Gratin</h3>

<p>Blanch (by placing in boiling water) 1 lb. of
onions, then divide them into quarters and
boil in milk and water until tender. Cut them
up, moisten them with some of the liquid in which
they were boiled, mash them smoothly, add a
cupful of cream, or one of milk enriched with
the yolk of an egg, pepper and salt. Place the
purée in a fireproof dish, which has been buttered,
strew some grated cheese over, and sprinkle a
little melted butter over all. Bake until hot
throughout, and until the top is coloured.</p>

<p>It is worthy of note that where grated cheese
is mentioned, it is quite unnecessary to buy
Parmesan for the purpose. Any dry ends of
cheese, grated, will serve.</p>

<h3>Celeri à la Duchesse (Hot)</h3>

<p>Cook some celery slowly in equal parts of milk
and water, seasoned with salt and pepper; when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
cooked, lift out, cut it up, and place a layer of it
in a fireproof dish, seasoning with salt and
pepper, and moistening with some béchamel or
any good white sauce, and continue these layers
until the dish is full, taking care to raise it up
in the centre; strew it rather thickly with grated
Parmesan cheese; moisten it with some oiled
butter, and put it into the oven for 10 minutes,
to colour nicely.</p>

<h3>Fried Celery (Hot)</h3>

<p>Thoroughly wash three heads of celery, remove
the leaves, and cut into 4 inch lengths, then
put in a stewpan with ½ a pint of stock and a
seasoning of pepper and salt. Simmer gently
for a quarter of an hour. Let the celery cool,
then take it out, dip it in egg and breadcrumb,
and fry in butter. Serve very hot, and hand
tomato sauce with it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>How to Cook Corn, Haricot Beans, and Lentils, and
to Make Vegetable Soufflés.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Of all the cereals none, I think, yields a better
result than corn—known to some people as green,
and to others as Indian corn or maize. Freshly
cut, boiled, and eaten with salt, pepper, and oiled
butter, it is delicious; but every one, alas, does
not grow it, and many folk have to be content
with the tinned corn, which, nevertheless, is
excellent. It may be bought in tins of two sizes,
and is quite inexpensive.</p>

<h3>To Cook Corn</h3>

<p>Open a small tin of corn and strain off the
liquid, and then simmer the corn until tender,
but not “mashy,” in 3 tablespoonsful of milk,
½ oz. of butter, pepper and salt. About 10
minutes will suffice for the cooking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span></p>

<h3>Corn with Buttered Egg</h3>

<p>Have ready the buttered egg, and pile it in
the centre of a hot fireproof dish, surround with
the cooked corn and garnish with small circles
of fried bread.</p>

<h3>Egg and Corn Toast</h3>

<p>Prepare the egg and corn as before, stir them
together and serve very hot on buttered toast.</p>

<h3>Corn with Poached Eggs</h3>

<p>Spread the cooked corn flat on a hot fireproof
dish, and arrange the poached eggs neatly on it,
and serve very hot.</p>

<h3>Corn au Gratin</h3>

<p>Cook the corn as before, and have ready a delicate
white sauce as below. Heat a fireproof dish,
butter it, and sprinkle with fine brown crumbs.
Heat the corn in the sauce, and place it in the
dish, cover with grated cheese and crumbs, and
bake for 20 minutes in a hot oven.</p>

<h3>White Sauce</h3>

<p>Melt 2 oz. of fresh butter, and sprinkle into
it 1½ oz. of dry sifted flour. Stir until the sauce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
will leave a clean place in the pan when lifted in
the spoon. Add quite gradually ½ pint of milk,
stirring all the time. Bring to the boil, and cook
for 10 minutes. Season with salt and white
pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice. Half water
and half milk or stock may be used instead of all
milk, and a spoonful or two of cream added just
at the last is an improvement. If a</p>

<h3>Cheese Sauce</h3>

<p>is required add a piled-up tablespoonful of finely-grated
cheese, stirring it in well so that it shall
be smooth.</p>

<h3>Corn au Gratin with Tomato Sauce</h3>

<p>Prepare as before, using tomato sauce instead
of white sauce.</p>

<h3>Tomato Sauce</h3>

<p>Take 6 small tomatoes, slice them and place
in a pan with 1 oz. of butter, salt and pepper,
and 1 pint of stock and water, or milk and water.
Boil until soft, sieve, and thicken with 1 oz. of
white roux (flour and butter cooked until smooth,
as described in “White Sauce”). Stir until
smooth and very hot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span></p>

<h3>Corn Fritters</h3>

<p>½ tin of corn, 2 eggs, 2 tablespoonsful of flour,
1 tablespoonful finely-chopped parsley, seasoning
to taste. Drain the corn into a bowl; stir in
the flour carefully, add the parsley, season, and
lastly, well beat the eggs, and stir those in. Have
ready some boiling fat in a frying-pan, into which
the batter should be dropped in dessertspoonsful.
Drain on kitchen paper, and serve at once on a
hot dish.</p>

<h3>Corn Rissoles.</h3>

<p>Take the cooked corn and beat it in white,
cheese, or tomato sauce, and then leave until
cold. Form into rissoles, egg and crumb and fry.
Serve very hot, garnished with fried parsley.</p>

<h3>Omelette with Corn</h3>

<p>Prepare the omelette as usual, and have ready
some corn heated in white sauce. Just before
serving the omelette spread the inner portion
with the hot corn.</p>

<h3>Curried Corn.</h3>

<p>Prepare the corn as before, and heat in a good
curry sauce. Pile in the centre of a hot dish and
surround with boiled rice garnished with sieved
yolk of egg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span></p>

<h3>Curry Sauce</h3>

<p>Slice an onion and ½ a small apple finely, and
fry them in 2 oz. of clarified dripping or butter.
Stir in ½ a dessertspoonful of curry powder
and the same of flour. Salt to taste. Add ¼
pint of stock or milk, cook gently for 30
minutes, then put all through a sieve, add a few
drops of lemon juice, and reheat.</p>

<h3>“Humitas”</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>A Chili dish</i>)</p>

<p>Grate some fresh green corn, add a little sugar
and red pepper.</p>

<p>Fry this slightly in clarified dripping. Arrange
two leaves from the sugar-corn, the broad
part lapping over the other. Fill this with about
a tablespoonful of the mixture, then fold it up
neatly in the leaves, tying it with a thin strip
from another, and bake.</p>

<p>When the fresh corn is not in season, the corn
in tins will answer the same purpose if cooked
and passed through a wire sieve and wrapped in
vine leaves.</p>

<h3>Corn and Cheese Cream</h3>

<p>Cook the corn, mix it into the cheese cream,
and serve very hot on buttered toast. For the
Cheese Cream <i>see</i> page <a href="#Page_71">71</a>.</p>

<p>The serving of these recipes may be varied:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
for instance, instead of sending corn au gratin to
table in one large dish, bake and serve it in small
brown or green earthen pipkins, one to each
person, or in the centre of a croûton of fried
bread.</p>

<p>It is worth noting, too, that haricot beans may
be substituted for corn in any of these recipes.
They should be soaked for 2 to 4 hours, and
then boiled in stock or water for 3 hours.</p>

<h3>Haricot Beans</h3>

<p>Haricot beans must be soaked for quite 12
hours in cold water, then put into a pan with cold
water slightly salted, (½ oz. of salt to 1 gallon of
water,) brought slowly to the boil, then drawn
aside and simmered for about 2 hours.</p>

<h3>Haricot Beans à la Milanaise (Hot)</h3>

<p>Boil the beans as directed and serve with a
covering of sauce à la Milanaise, which should be
made in the following manner: Scald 4 onions
for 5 minutes in boiling water, then dry them
and cut them up, place them in a saucepan with
a pinch of sugar, 1 oz. of butter, and a saltspoonful
of salt. Boil a tablespoonful of rice, and when
cooked add it to the onion; moisten with ½ pint
of milk or water, cook slowly, stirring occasionally;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
when the onions are soft add 1 tablespoonful of
finely-grated cheese. Mix well and pass through
a sieve, add to this ½ pint of white sauce, mix
thoroughly, repeat and pour over the beans.</p>

<h3>Haricot Beans with Tomato Purée</h3>

<p>Cook the beans as before and serve covered
with tomato purée (<i>see</i> page <a href="#Page_18">18</a>.)</p>

<h3>Haricot Beans with Soubise (Onion) Sauce</h3>

<p>Cook the haricots as before and serve with
onion sauce poured over and croûtons of fried
bread arranged round.</p>

<h3>Soubise Sauce</h3>

<p>Take 2 large onions, peel them and put
them in boiling water for 5 minutes. Strain,
slice, and place in a pan with 1 oz. of clarified
dripping and stew until tender. Lift the pan
from the fire and stir in ½ pint of melted butter
sauce. Let it boil, stir for about 7 to 10 minutes,
and then rub through a hair sieve.</p>

<h3>Lentils</h3>

<p>Soak the lentils for at least 12 hours in cold
water. Then drain and place them in a pan with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
cold salted water (1 gallon of water to ½ oz. of
salt), bring them to the boil, then draw aside the
pan and simmer, until the lentils are quite soft,
about 1 hour. After having been cooked like this
they can be served in any of the methods advised,
for haricot beans or plain, save for the addition
of a pat of butter melting among them, a sprinkling
of chopped parsley, and a shake of pepper
and salt.</p>

<h3>Lentils with Curry Sauce</h3>

<p>Cook the lentils as before and serve with plenty
of curried sauce poured over. For the curry
sauce <i>see</i> page <a href="#Page_45">45</a>.</p>

<h3>Maigre Soufflés</h3>

<p>There is no nicer way of serving such vegetables
as cabbage, spinach, artichokes, or celery,
than in the form of a soufflé, which may appear
as an entrée or second course dish, or as a
vegetable to accompany meat or poultry.</p>

<p>Savoury soufflés of rice and of macaroni are
also delicious, and although all soufflés require care
in the cooking, a cook of moderate abilities will
soon master the art of making these delicious
dishes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span></p>

<h3>Vegetable Soufflé</h3>

<p>Have ready about ½ lb. of any carefully made
and well-flavoured vegetable purée—spinach,
cabbage, turnip tops, Brussels-sprouts, carrot,
turnip (or both mixed) artichoke, tomato, or
celery. Then put 1 gill of water and 1 oz. of
butter into a pan with a pinch of salt. Directly
this comes to the boil, stir in 1 oz. of flour,
stirring it well with a wooden spoon for 2 or 3
minutes, put in the purée, and just remove the
pan for a little, add the yolks of 2 eggs, 1 at
a time, and 1 whole egg, and finally the whites
of 2 eggs beaten to a stiff froth. Have ready
a papered soufflé dish, fill it three-quarters of
the way up, bake in a hot oven for 10 minutes,
and serve at once, first removing the paper
and wiping the dish.</p>

<p>The purée may be prepared at any time, but
the eggs should only be added just before the
soufflé is to be baked. The dish (china or tin)
in which the soufflé is baked must be well greased
and a greased paper tied round. The mixture rises
so strenuously that if the dish is 3 parts full
(and it should be to look well when served), the
paper is required to prevent the mixture from
falling over, as it rises just above the edges of
the dish. When baking the soufflé do not bang the
oven door, and open it very gently, and, by degrees
when taking the soufflé out. If kept waiting the
soufflé will fall and become tough. So with these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
dishes the diners must wait for the soufflé rather
than the soufflé for the diners.</p>

<h3>Vegetable Purée</h3>

<p>This is merely the vegetable boiled in water
or stock, and then put through a sieve so that
it forms a preparation resembling a very thick
custard. Spinach à la crême (page <a href="#Page_20">20</a>) and
purée of watercress, lettuce, and turnip tops
(pages <a href="#Page_16">16</a> and <a href="#Page_17">17</a>) are excellent foundations for
soufflés. Such vegetables as artichokes and celery
should be treated as follows:—</p>

<h3>Celery Soufflé (Hot)</h3>

<p>Wash some celery well, and remove all the outside
parts, cut up ½ lb., put it on in cold, salted
water, bring this to the boil, take out the celery
and drain. Put the celery into a pan with 1½
gills of milk, half a bayleaf, a blade of mace, a
slice of onion, and boil it all till tender, then sieve
the celery, and it is ready for the soufflé.</p>

<h3>Savoury Rice Soufflé</h3>

<p>Wash 2 oz. of rice and then place it in ¾ of a
pint of boiling stock (fish or vegetable stock),
and cook until the rice swells and is soft without
being pulpy. Drain it and let it cool, and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
stir into it 1 oz. of fresh butter, 2 or 3 tablespoonsful
of tomato purée, salt and pepper the beaten
yolks of 2 eggs and then the frothed whites.
Bake in a soufflé dish prepared as already
described.</p>

<h3>Mushroom and Rice Soufflé</h3>

<p>Proceed as before, but use stewed mushrooms
instead of the tomato purée.</p>

<h3>Rice and Cheese Soufflé</h3>

<p>Proceed exactly as for Savoury Rice Soufflé
but add 2 oz. of grated cheese.</p>

<h3>Macaroni Soufflé</h3>

<p>Proceed as for Rice Soufflé, using about the
same bulk of cooked macaroni (cut into half inch
lengths) as of cooked rice.</p>

<small>DISHES MADE WITH MACARONI AND
SPAGHETTI</small></h2>
</div>

<h3>Macaroni and Spaghetti</h3>

<p><i>To Boil.</i>—Macaroni or spaghetti should be
boiled in the same way as rice, namely, thrown
into boiling salted water, and should never under
any circumstances be soaked or placed in cold
water previously. They should be tested occasionally
with a fork, and when tender a teacupful
of cold water should be thrown into the pan to
stop the boiling, the pan should then be lifted
from the fire, the macaroni or spaghetti drained
of all liquid and returned to the hot dry pan and
kept hot until wanted. The time for boiling is
from 20 to 30 minutes. The following dishes can
be made of either preparation:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span></p>

<h3>Macaroni à la Napolitaine (Hot)</h3>

<p>Boil 3 oz. of macaroni in the manner described
above, and after it has been returned to the pan
in which it was boiled, stir into it 2 oz. of Parmesan
cheese finely grated and 1 oz. of butter.
The cheese should be stirred in half at a time and
well shaken amongst the macaroni. Season with
black pepper and salt and serve at once very hot.</p>

<h3>Macaroni à la Italienne (Hot)</h3>

<p>Follow the preceding recipe for boiling the
macaroni, and having returned it to the pan, stir
into it 1 oz. of cheese finely grated, 1 oz. of butter,
and then ½ pint of tomato purée (<i>see</i> page <a href="#Page_18">18</a>).
Mix well and serve very hot piled on a dish.</p>

<h3>Macaroni au Gratin (Hot)</h3>

<p>Boil the macaroni by the directions given
above, then mix into it 1 oz. of grated cheese and
1 oz. of butter, stir well and place the mixture
neatly in a fireproof dish, sprinkle over it ½ oz.
of grated cheese and the same amount of dried
breadcrumbs. Melt ½ oz. of butter and pour it
over the whole. Place in the oven (until a light
brown colour) for 10 minutes, then serve.</p>

<h3>Macaroni Cheese (Hot)</h3>

<p>Butter a fireproof dish and in it place 3 oz. of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
macaroni previously boiled, dust it with pepper
and salt. Make a good white sauce and add to
it 2 oz. of grated cheese. Pour this all over the
macaroni and sprinkle the top with grated cheese
and a few dried breadcrumbs. Place in the oven
and cook until a golden brown and serve in the
dish in which it is cooked.</p>

<h3>Macaroni au Jus (made with Meat Stock) (Hot)</h3>

<p>Boil 3 oz. of macaroni for 10 minutes, drain off
the water and pour into the pan ½ to ¾ pint
of brown stock, simmer the macaroni until tender,
pour off the stock; but should the macaroni
have absorbed it all, take enough to moisten the
whole, thicken it in the usual way, and add
browning to colour it. Place the macaroni on a
hot dish—it should be kept hot in the pan while
the sauce is making; pour the gravy over it and
serve.</p>

<h3>Buttered Macaroni (Hot)</h3>

<p>Boil 2 oz. of macaroni and drain it well. Put
2 oz. of butter into a thoroughly warmed pie dish,
put the macaroni on top of this, and mix it all
well together with two forks, sprinkling in at the
same time freshly-grated cheese and coralline
pepper. When thoroughly mixed and the butter
all absorbed, sprinkle it with more pepper and
cheese, and serve at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span></p>

<h3>Poached Eggs and Macaroni (Hot)</h3>

<p>Break some macaroni up into inch pieces, rinse
it well; put 2 oz. of butter into a fireproof dish,
put the macaroni in, and pour enough milk over
it to thoroughly cover it, stirring it now and again.
When three-quarters cooked, lift it out, and put
it into another dish, seasoning it well with pepper
and salt, and pour over it ½ pint of good brown
gravy, then put it back in the oven again and
leave it till cooked. When ready lay some
poached eggs on it, sprinkle liberally with Parmesan
cheese, coralline pepper, and serve.</p>

<h3>Macaroni Cutlets (Hot)</h3>

<p>4 oz. macaroni, 4 oz. grated cheese, 1 oz.
flour, ½ oz. flour, ½ pint of milk, 1 teaspoonful
French mustard, breadcrumbs, 1 egg, cayenne
and salt. Boil the macaroni in water until it is
quite tender, then cut it into pieces of half an
inch in length. Melt the butter in a stewpan,
add the flour gradually, stirring until there are
no lumps, add the milk and stir over the fire until
the sauce thickens. Mix the macaroni, cheese,
mustard, pinch of cayenne and salt to taste, with
the sauce, then turn out on to a plate and leave
until cold. Form into cutlets or small rolls, roll
in breadcrumbs, then dip in beaten egg, and again
roll in crumbs. Fry the cutlets in boiling fat
until they are a golden brown colour, then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
serve with a garnish of fried parsley. If the
mixture is formed into cutlet shape place a small
piece of raw macaroni at the thin end to represent
the bone.</p>

<h3>Fish and Macaroni (Hot)</h3>

<p>Cook the macaroni until quite tender, then cut
it into small pieces; meanwhile flake ½ lb. of
cooked fish, free from shin and bones, and make
a good stock from the bones and trimmings of the
fish. Melt 1 oz. of butter, stir into this ½ oz. of
flour, strain in ½ pint of the fish stock, and
bring it all to the boil; then put in the fish and
macaroni, season to taste with salt and pepper,
turn into a buttered fireproof dish, and bake in
the oven for 10 minutes.</p>

<h3>Macaroni with Tomatoes</h3>

<p>Remove the stalks of the tomatoes, cut each
one into four pieces, then put them into a saucepan
with a little water, a bayleaf, and a sprig of
basil, and season with pepper and salt to taste;
now boil till thoroughly done, when you turn
them out on to a hair sieve, allowing them to
stand for a minute or so, in order that all the
water may drain off and be thrown away; then
pass the tomatoes through a sieve with a wooden
spoon, heat up the pulp well with a good lump of
butter, and then dress the previously-boiled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
macaroni with this, and plenty of grated Parmesan,
or any good, strongly flavoured cheese which
will grate well.</p>

<h3>Italian Cake (Hot) (made with Suet)</h3>

<p>Boil 2 oz. of macaroni till tender, drain well
and cut into small pieces, then pound it with 2
eggs, 8 oz. of grated Parmesan cheese, 4 oz.
mutton suet, and season to taste with pepper and
salt; steam in a basin or mould for 70 minutes.
Turn out and serve with tomato or any other
savoury sauce to taste. 2 beaten yolks of egg
may be substituted for the suet.</p>

<h3>Spaghetti Pudding (Hot)</h3>

<p>Cook 4 oz. of spaghetti as previously directed,
drain it and place half of it in a pie dish, grate
2 oz. of cheese (a good cooking one should be
chosen), and sprinkle some of it over the spaghetti,
slice 4 or 5 small tomatoes and place them
on the bed of macaroni, sprinkling them with
cheese, pepper and salt, and finish with the remainder
of the macaroni, placing the rest of the
cheese on the top. Pour carefully over this ½
pint of milk and cover the dish with a plate or
small dish, cook in a moderate oven. A fireproof
dish with a fitting cover would be useful for
this dish, but if not procurable a pie dish can quite
well be used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span></p>

<h3>Baked Tomatoes and Macaroni (Hot)</h3>

<p>Cut 4 or 5 tomatoes of the same size into halves
and place them in a baking-tin with a small piece
of butter on each and dust them with black
pepper and nutmeg. Bake from 15 to 20 minutes.
Have ready 6 oz. of macaroni boiled and
hot, place this in a circle on a hot dish, arrange
the tomatoes inside this and pour over the spaghetti
a rich cheese sauce. Serve very hot.</p>

<h3>Spaghetti à l’Indienne (Hot)</h3>

<p>Make a curry sauce by slicing 2 small onions
and frying them in butter until a light brown,
add to them 2 teaspoonsful of curry powder and
a tablespoonful of lemon juice or rather less of
vinegar, a tablespoonful of sugar, a pinch of salt
and two raw apples chopped very finely, stir in
1½ pints of water and simmer until the ingredients
have become a pulp. Place ½ lb. of spaghetti
in boiling water, and when partly cooked
remove it, drain, and finish cooking it in the
sauce. Serve very hot.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>DISHES MADE WITH RICE</small></h2>
</div>

<h3>Rice</h3>

<p><i>To Boil.</i>—Place the rice in a pan of fast boiling
water and be careful to choose one large
enough for it. 1 to 1½ oz. of rice should be cooked
in a quart pan, which should be three-parts full of
water, and have ½ a teaspoonful of salt and a
few drops of lemon juice in it, the latter to preserve
the whiteness of the rice. Stir occasionally.
Boil the rice for 10 to 15 minutes, but test it at
the former time by pressing it between the
finger and thumb. When the grains feel soft
remove the saucepan from the fire at once and
drain off the water; return the rice to the pan
and set it on the corner of the stove to dry, shaking
it occasionally. Some grains of rice will
always stick to the pan, and to remove these
put a small pat of butter in the pan, and as
this melts the grains will fall away. The rice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
will take quite 10 minutes to dry and should
never be served until the moisture has been got
rid of and the grains separated. Remember
always that rice swells very much in the cooking
process, hence the necessity of the large pan
and amount of water required. Carolina rice
swells more than Patna and so requires rather
more water than the latter. If the rice is boiled
too slowly or for too long a time the result will
be a sticky mass. A good plan is to pour in a
pint of cold water when the rice is sufficiently
cooked. This stops the boiling at once and helps
to separate the grains; if put close to the stove
when the rice is first put into the pan, the cook
will be able to throw it into the pan the moment
the rice is tender. If the rice is to be served
with meat in place of a vegetable, the rice should
only be partly cooked and the water all drained
off, and then ½ pint to 1 pint of stock put in the
pan. This should be simmered until quite cooked,
drained and served.</p>

<p>Another method of boiling rice, though totally
different to the foregoing, is equally successful.
Place the rice in cold water and allow it to come
to the boil. After boiling for a few minutes and
when the grains are tender when pressed between
the finger and thumb, throw in a jugful of cold
water, remove the pan from the fire, and pour
both rice and water on to a wire sieve, shake
well, and when the water has run away sufficiently,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
place the sieve with the rice upon it
in the oven to thoroughly dry it. The grains
will fall away from each other and the rice is
ready for use.</p>

<p>Rice is even better as a vegetable if it is cooked
some time before being wanted, covered over,
and reheated in the oven before use; the grains
are drier than when only cooked and served at
once.</p>

<h3>Fried Rice</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Served as a vegetable</i></p>

<p>Boil ½ lb. of rice as directed, and when it is
thoroughly dried fry it in 1 oz. of butter until
slightly browned. Dust with pepper and salt
and serve piled in a dish.</p>

<h3>Devilled Rice</h3>

<p>Proceed as for Fried Rice, but mix in a pinch
of curry powder with the hot liquid butter.</p>

<h3>Rice à l’Italienne (Hot)</h3>

<p>Boil the rice in the manner described on page
<a href="#Page_60">60</a>, and to 4 oz. when cooked and drained, stir in
1 oz. of butter, dust with salt and pepper and
stir well, mixing thoroughly; add sufficient
tomato sauce to moisten the whole, and add<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
2 oz. of finely-grated cheese. Mix well and serve
very hot.</p>

<h3>Risotto à la Milanaise (Hot)</h3>

<p>Fry 3 oz. of chopped onion in 2 oz. of butter
or clarified dripping until of a golden brown
colour, then add 6 oz. of rice, stir without stopping
for 2 or 3 minutes, add by degrees 1 pint of
stock, stir occasionally and simmer gently until
the rice is just soft, add a very small amount of
grated nutmeg and 1½ oz. of grated cheese before
the rice is cooked; after this stir and cook for
3 or 4 minutes until the rice is quite soft. Take
off the pan, add a small pat of butter, stir well
and serve very hot.</p>

<h3>Risotto, No. 1 (Hot)</h3>

<p>Place in a saucepan ½ pint of milk, a small teacupful
of raw rice, 4 small Portugal onions, 6 good-sized
tomatoes, these latter ingredients chopped
finely, pepper and salt to taste. Boil all together
until soft, stirring occasionally, and just
before serving stir in 1½ oz. of finely-grated
cheese.</p>

<h3>Risotto, No. 2, made with Stock (Hot)</h3>

<p>Chop half an onion very finely and fry it in
½ oz. of butter. Place 4 oz. of rice in a saucepan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
with ½ pint of stock, add the onion and cook until
the stock is absorbed. Stir in 1 oz. of grated
Parmesan cheese, pepper and salt to taste. Make
very hot and serve.</p>

<h3>Stewed Rice and Cabbage, made with Stock (Hot)</h3>

<p>Boil in the ordinary way separately equal
quantities of rice and cabbage. The latter cut
into small pieces before they are quite cooked,
remove them from their respective pans and place
them together in a stewpan with just as much
stock as will cover them, simmer until quite
cooked (probable time, 5 minutes), and serve with
a covering of grated cheese.</p>

<h3>Rice Savoury (Hot)</h3>

<p>Boil 3 oz. of rice in ½ pint of milk, season with
pepper and salt; butter a pie dish, lay in a layer
of rice, sprinkle this with 1 oz. of grated cheese,
add the rest of the rice, sprinkle with another
ounce of cheese, dot some small pieces of butter
all over the top; bake in a quick oven till nicely
browned on the top.</p>

<h3>Rice Balls (Hot)</h3>

<p>Boil 4 oz. of rice in cold water, taking care to
let it absorb all the liquid; to this add 1 tablespoonful
of finely-grated cheese, 1 teaspoonful of
chopped parsley, 1 oz. of finely-grated brown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
breadcrumbs, 1 tablespoonful of tomato sauce,
pepper and salt to taste; bind all the ingredients
with the yolks of 2 eggs, mixing thoroughly,
form into balls, brush over with white of egg, roll
in breadcrumbs and fry a golden brown.</p>

<h3>Rice and Fish Toast (Hot)</h3>

<p>Fry an onion, finely-sliced, in butter with a few
shrimps or pieces of lobster, stir into it 1 dessertspoonful
of mustard. When thoroughly hot, add
a teacupful of rice previously boiled and dried
and a tablespoonful of grated Parmesan cheese.
Stir and serve very hot on rounds of buttered
toast or fried croûtons.</p>

<h3>Savoury Rice Pudding (Hot)</h3>

<p>Simmer 2 tablespoonsful of rice in 1 pint of
milk until nearly cooked, then add 1 oz. of finely-grated
cheese, ½ oz. of butter, 1 teaspoonful of
made mustard, a pinch of salt and a dust of cayenne
pepper. Mix all together and pour into a
buttered pie dish, sprinkle ½ oz. of finely-grated
cheese on the top and bake in a moderate oven
for ½ hour.</p>

<small>CHEESE DISHES</small></h2>
</div>

<h3>Welsh Rarebit (Hot)</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Note.</i>—As a general rule where Parmesan cheese is
mentioned, any well-dried and finely-grated cheese
serves the purpose.</p>
</div>

<p>Slice down some good, rich cheese rather thinly,
into a delicately clean stewpan, with some morsels
of butter, and 2 or 3 spoonsful of porter, good
ale, or new milk as you please, according to the
quantity of the cheese; flavour to taste with
freshly-ground black pepper and English mustard.
Stir it all till thoroughly melted, pour it over hot
buttered toast, browning the surface if you like
with a hot shovel, and serve at once.</p>

<p>This requires careful watching, because if it be
in the least over-cooked it will be leathery.</p>

<h3>Irish Rarebit (Hot)</h3>

<p>Add a few drops of vinegar and a finely-minced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
pickled gherkin to cheese treated as above, and
serve very hot.</p>

<h3>Baked Cheese Sandwiches (Hot)</h3>

<p>Cut some slices of good, rich cheese about a
third of an inch thick, season lightly with freshly-ground
black pepper, and a drop or two of tarragon
vinegar; then place them between two slices
of brown bread and butter; trim these neatly,
and set them in the oven, serving them directly
the bread is toasted.</p>

<h3>Parmesan Puffs (Hot)</h3>

<p>Mix 4½ oz. of breadcrumbs, 4 oz. of Parmesan
cheese, 2 oz. of butter, ½ a teaspoonful of cayenne
pepper and salt, and 2 eggs; pound these all
thoroughly in a mortar, bind them with a well-beaten
egg, shape into balls about the size of a
walnut, egg and breadcrumb them, and fry a
golden brown in plenty of boiling fat. Drain
well, and serve at once very hot, garnished with
parsley.</p>

<h3>Parmesan Eggs (Hot)</h3>

<p>Take a flat fireproof dish and put into it the
yolks of 2 eggs, a small pat of butter, some
spice, and a tablespoonful of finely-grated Parmesan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
cheese. Stir over the stove. Then break
into it five or six eggs and sprinkle the whole with
grated cheese. Brown and serve.</p>

<h3>Cheese Balls (Hot)</h3>

<p>Put 1 pint of water into a pan with 1 oz. of
butter when quite hot, dredge in 4 oz. of flour,
and pepper and salt to taste, draw to one side and
when cooled a little add the yolks of 4 eggs and
4 oz. of grated cheese. Have ready a pan of boiling
fat, take the mixture up in tablespoonsful,
drop in and fry a golden brown. Serve very hot.</p>

<h3>Cheese Butterflies (Cold)</h3>

<p>Take 2 oz. of flour, 1½ oz. of Parmesan cheese,
1 oz. of butter and the yolk of 1 egg. Make a
pastry of the above ingredients and roll out thin.
Then with a crinkled round cutter cut out double
the number of rounds you require to use and bake
a light brown. Allow them to become cold.
Mix some grated cheese with a little whipped
cream to a nice thick consistency, season with salt
and cayenne pepper, pile lightly on the rounds of
pastry. (Some of the rounds must be cut into
halves <i>before baking</i> to provide the wings for the
butterflies.) Dip the crinkled edges of the halves
into carmine to colour them, and arrange them as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
wings on the rounds of pastry. Put a piece of
stalk of parsley to form each antennae; also
arrange or ornament the back of each butterfly
with a little of the green leaf of the parsley.</p>

<h3>Cheese Pudding (Hot)</h3>

<p>Place 1 pint of milk in a saucepan and let it
become hot, then pour it on to 1 tablespoonful of
ground rice previously mixed with a little cold
milk, return to the pan and stir until the mixture
thickens. Remove the pan from the fire and
add 4 oz. of finely-grated cheese, a pinch of salt
and cayenne, the yolks of 2 eggs, and 2 oz. of
butter. Mix all well together and then add the
beaten whites of the eggs. Butter a pie dish and
pour the mixture into it, and bake in a moderate
oven for 20 minutes. Sprinkle grated cheese
over the top before serving.</p>

<h3>Cheese Aigrettes (Hot)</h3>

<p>Place 1 oz. of butter in a pan with ½ pint of
water; when boiling add 3 oz. of flour. Stir over
the fire until the mixture leaves the sides of the
pan quite clean. Remove the pan from the fire
and when slightly cool add the yolks of 3 eggs
and the whites of 2, cayenne and salt to taste.
Stir in 2 oz. of grated Parmesan cheese, and place
the mixture on a plate to cool. Take a small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
piece of the mixture in a spoon and drop it in hot
fat and fry a golden brown; continue this until
it is used up. Serve on a dish paper garnished
with parsley and sprinkled with grated cheese.</p>

<h3>Cheese Patties (Hot)</h3>

<p>Line some patty pans with puff pastry and fill
them three-parts full with the following mixture.
Place 2 oz. of finely-grated breadcrumbs in a
basin and mix into them 1 raw egg and a tablespoonful
of milk; then add 2 tablespoonsful of
finely-grated cheese and 2 teaspoonsful of butter,
1 teaspoonful of made mustard, ½ a teaspoonful
of salt and the same of pepper. Mix very well.
Place the patties in the oven and bake until a
pale brown. The mixture will swell slightly in
baking. Serve very hot.</p>

<h3>Cheese Mushrooms (Hot)</h3>

<p>Take ½ lb. of rich toasting cheese, slice it, place it
on a soup plate. Cover it with flap mushrooms—on
each mushroom a nut of butter and a dust of
pepper and salt. Cover with another soup plate
and bake in a moderate oven for half an hour.
Dish up on buttered toast.</p>

<h3>Cheese Custard Pudding (Hot or Cold)</h3>

<p>Put 2 oz. of finely-grated cheese into a basin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
and add to it 2 well-beaten eggs and ¾ pint of
milk. Trim the edge of a pie dish with cheese
pastry and pour in the mixture. Place 2 or 3
pieces of butter on the top and bake in a quick
oven (400 deg.) for 20 minutes.</p>

<h3>Cheese Croûtons (Hot)</h3>

<p>Take 6 rounds of bread ¾ inch thick and about
the size of a five shilling piece, fry them a golden
brown colour, sprinkle over them a dust of dry
mustard, a layer of grated cheese, salt and pepper
to taste. Place them in a quick oven until the
cheese is cooked, then place a spoonful of hot rice
on each, garnish with capers and serve very hot.</p>

<h3>Cheese Canapés (Cold)</h3>

<p>Grate 2 oz. of cheese and mix it smoothly in a
basin with a dessertspoonful of mustard, the same
of anchovy sauce, a shake of cayenne, a pinch of
salt, a dessertspoonful of anchovy vinegar, a
tablespoonful of fresh butter and the yolks of 2
hard-boiled eggs. Mix this until it is a smooth
paste, then spread it on rounds of buttered white
or brown bread. Chop the whites of the eggs
finely or press them through a sieve on to the
paste. Serve cold.</p>

<h3>Little Cheese Custards (Hot)</h3>

<p>Grate finely 3½ oz. of cheese and mix it with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
1 egg, add ¼ pint of boiling milk, pour the mixture
into small fireproof dishes and bake for 10
to 15 minutes. Serve hot in the dishes.</p>

<h3>Cheese Patties (Hot)</h3>

<p>Line the required number of patty pans with
puff pastry. Boil 1 oz. of macaroni in just
as much water as it will absorb. When soft cut it
into tiny pieces, mix with it 1 oz. of finely-grated
cheese, a pinch of salt, a pinch of cayenne, and
bind the mixture with a little cream or cheese
sauce. Bake for 10 minutes.</p>

<h3>Tomato Cheese Croûtons (Hot)</h3>

<p>Stew ½ lb. of tomatoes in butter until tender
with onion cut up finely, put them through a
sieve, adding a small quantity of cream, or milk
if the former is not procurable. Replace the
tomato in the pan and add to it enough grated
cheese to make it like a thick cream, season
with pepper and place a little of the mixture in
croûtons of fried bread. Serve very hot.</p>

<h3>Cream of Cheese</h3>

<p>Make some squares of hot buttered toast,
place on a hot dish and keep hot. Melt ½ lb. of
cheese in a little saucepan with 1 oz. of butter
and 3 tablespoonsful of cream (or milk), pepper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
and salt. When of the consistency of very thick
custard pour it over the toast and serve.</p>

<small>OMELETTES AND CURRIES</small></h2>
</div>

<h3>Omelette</h3>

<p>Break two eggs into a basin, season with salt,
pepper, minced parsley, and chives, etc., and beat
these all together for about 1 minute. Melt
1 oz. of butter in an absolutely clean pan (it is
best to keep a pan on purpose for omelettes), and
when this smokes, pour in the eggs, and do not
touch them for a few seconds, till the liquid has
set a little at the bottom of the pan; tilt the pan
a trifle to one side, and if there is a small puff of
steam, lift the edge up carefully with a knife to
allow as much of the liquid as possible to run
underneath; repeat this till there is no more egg
liquid left, and the top just set, slip a knife under
the omelette, fold it over, and slip it at once on to
a hot dish, and serve immediately. This can be
varied, of course, to any extent, by, just before
folding it over, slipping in any kind of vegetable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
mixture, such as mushrooms, chopped up and
previously lightly fried in a little butter.</p>

<h3>Potato Omelette</h3>

<p>To 4 eggs add 2 tablespoonsful of very smoothly
mashed potato, add a tablespoonful of cream, a
small piece of butter, pepper and salt, whip all
together and then fry as before.</p>

<h3>Green Pea Omelette</h3>

<p>Place between the omelette a few green peas,
made very hot, and tossed in butter, salt and
pepper.</p>

<h3>Asparagus Omelette</h3>

<p>Fold the omelette over a few cooked asparagus
tops, which have been made hot.</p>

<h3>Tomato Omelette</h3>

<p>Make an ordinary omelette, and before serving
pour this mixture into it. Take two or three
tomatoes and cut them into pieces, cut an onion
into very thin slices, melt a tablespoonful of
butter into a saucepan and place the onion in it.
Cook them, but do not brown, add pepper, salt
and the pieces of tomato. Stir all together for 10<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
minutes, take out the mixture, pass it through a
sieve, and return to the pan, thoroughly reheat
and it is ready for use.</p>

<h3>Cheese Omelette</h3>

<p>Add an heaped-up tablespoonful of grated
cheese to the ordinary omelette mixture, sprinkling
some over it just before serving.</p>

<h3>French Bean Omelette</h3>

<p>Heat some cooked French beans in butter and
place them between a plain omelette.</p>

<p>Recipes for omelette made with flour, anchovy,
cheese, mushroom, and sardine omelettes will be
found in <i>Savouries Simplified</i>, by Mrs. C. S. Peel.</p>

<h3>Some Maigre Curries</h3>

<p>There are, of course, many varieties of curry.
The recipe for one of worth is given in my <i>10s.
a Head Cookery Book</i>, and I here add another,
but before giving detailed recipes let us deal with
the broad rules for curry making, the most important
of all being—</p>

<p>Do not attempt to make curry in a hurry.</p>

<p>2 hours is the least in which you can make
a vegetable curry worthy of the name, and it is
far wiser to allow 3 or 4 hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>Do not ask your cook to make curry on a day
when she is very busy with other matters, for it
will take an hour or more of undivided attention
as well as a certain amount of attention throughout
the time of cooking.</p>

<p>There is, however, no reason that curry should
not be made the day before it is wanted, for it
improves by keeping, and by being reheated.</p>

<h3>A Delicious Vegetable Curry</h3>

<p>Weigh 5 oz. of butter (or if economy must be
studied, 3 oz. of clarified dripping, and 2 oz. of
butter). Choose four medium-sized onions, and
chop them very fine. Melt the butter in a stewpan
and add the onions and cook them until they
are of a deep golden brown, stirring often. Meanwhile,
put 1 tablespoonful of curry powder in
a saucer in the oven for 10 minutes, then mix it
to a smooth paste with a little cream, or if this
cannot be allowed, some milk, and add it to the
onion mixture, and stir well. Cook slowly,
stirring frequently for 2 hours in all. During
this time the onions will become quite pulpy, and
the butter like oil, and the colour of the mixture
will slowly deepen to a rich mustard yellow.
While this “ghee,” as it is called, is cooking,
take 1 small vegetable marrow, cut in squares;
½ lb. of French beans, strung and broken in
half; 2 large tomatoes, quartered; ½ a small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
cucumber, peeled and sliced; 1 small apple,
peeled and cored and sliced; ½ a small carrot,
sliced. Boil the vegetables as usual, cooking
the larger and firmer longer than those of a
more delicate kind. Make the curry mixture
given above, and add the vegetables during the
last ½ hour of cooking. Serve with a border of
rice.</p>

<p>This recipe does not make a sloppy curry, but
one in which the solid ingredients are coated with
the thick sauce.</p>

<p>Other dishes, not properly curries though
flavoured with curry powder, are often termed
curry. They provide a quick and easy method
of serving various materials. For these a curry
sauce is needed.</p>

<h3>Curry Sauce</h3>

<p>Chop an onion and a few slices of apple finely
and fry them in 2 oz. of clarified dripping or
butter. Stir in ½ a dessertspoonful of curry
powder and the same of flour. Salt to taste.
Add ¼ pint of stock or milk, cook gently for 30
minutes, then put all through a sieve, add a few
drops of lemon juice, and reheat.</p>

<h3>Curried Cabbage</h3>

<p>Take all the outer leaves off a young cabbage
and boil it until it is half cooked. Drain it and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
chop it finely, place it in a pan with some curry
sauce and simmer it gently for 1 hour. Serve
in a border of boiled rice.</p>

<h3>Curried Potatoes</h3>

<p>Slice some hot boiled potatoes and pour over
them a curry sauce.</p>

<h3>Curried Macaroni</h3>

<p>Boil the quantity of macaroni required until
tender, drain it and cut it into pieces 1 inch in
length. Place it in the curry sauce already described
for 10 minutes, and serve in a rice border.</p>

<h3>Lentil Curry</h3>

<p>Take the cooked lentils (<i>see</i> page <a href="#Page_47">47</a>) and heat
them in curry sauce. Serve very hot in a border
of rice.</p>

<h3>Haricot Bean Curry</h3>

<p>Proceed as for Lentil Curry.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>SALADS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The English salad is not as a rule a success,
and undoubtedly the chief fault in its making lies
in the inferior quality of the oil used.</p>

<p>Provided with good oil the next point of importance
in a green salad is the condition of the
material. If the lettuces, endive, cress or watercress
are faded the salad is ruined. The lettuce,
etc., should of course be freshly cut, if possible,
but where this is not feasible it should be chosen
with care, and at once put into water—not
soused into a basin, but placed with its root only
in water—as if it were a flower—in a cool place.
In this way a lettuce will keep in perfect condition
for two or three days, if needs be. Cress
and endive should be treated likewise. Let us
now consider the making of</p>

<h3>French Salad</h3>

<p>Choose crisp lettuces, cut off the stalk and remove
the outer leaves (when well washed these
may be used for lettuce purée), tear the lettuce in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
pieces (on no account cut it), and wash it in a
bowl of cold water. Place it in a clean cloth and
swing it round until dry. This method of drying
by centrifugal force gets rid of the moisture and
does not bruise the lettuce.</p>

<p>Now rub the salad bowl very thoroughly with
a slice of onion, and if the flavour is liked place
half a small peeled onion in the centre of the
bowl. Mix in the bowl 1 dessertspoonful of the
best wine vinegar and 2 tablespoonsful of oil, and
add a little salt and a good dusting of freshly-ground
black pepper. Stir the lettuce round
lightly in the mixture and serve. This quantity
of oil and vinegar is sufficient for about 2 medium
lettuces, but only experience teaches the exact
quantity to use. The lettuce should not be
swimming in the mixture: the leaves should
merely be coated with it, and no remains of it
should be left at the bottom of the bowl when the
salad is mixed.</p>

<p>The chief faults of the average salad, next to
the use of inferior oil and flabby lettuce, are the
excess of dressing, the excess of vinegar, and the
use of pepper which is not freshly ground. A
salad prepared in the manner described is as
different as chalk is from cheese from the salad
which is generally put before one, and no
more difficult to make. Salads of endive, corn,
Batavian lettuce, or cress, should be made in just
the same manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>For orange salad and orange and cherry salad
a similar dressing is used, and I notice how these
fruit salads are growing in favour.</p>

<h3>Orange Salad</h3>

<p>simply consists of the sections of oranges free
from pith and skin, string and pips, arranged in
a bowl and dressed with oil and vinegar.</p>

<h3>Orange and Cherry Salad</h3>

<p>consists of glacé cherries arranged in the centre
of the bowl surrounded by sections of oranges,
and dressed with the same mixture.</p>

<p>Another excellent salad, not very generally
known, consists of sliced apple and shred celery;
it is known as</p>

<h3>Apple and Celery Salad,</h3>

<p>and is dressed with mayonnaise sauce, or with
whipped cream flavoured with salt and pepper.
This</p>

<h3>Cream Dressing</h3>

<p>is newer than mayonnaise, and is generally appreciated.
Another delicious salad on which it is
used is</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span></p>

<h3>Nut Salad</h3>

<p>This is made of Brazil nuts broken into pieces,
shred celery, and tiny dice of bread and butter.
This salad is equally good if dressed with cream
or with mayonnaise sauce.</p>

<p>As mayonnaise is generally spoiled by too overpowering
a use of vinegar, I give here an excellent
recipe in which the special oil and vinegar already
mentioned are employed.</p>

<h3>Good Mayonnaise Sauce</h3>

<p>To make mayonnaise sauce, first rinse the basin
in very cold water, and make the sauce in a cool
place, if possible keeping the basin on ice while
you mix the sauce. See that the oil is perfectly
good, and add it drop by drop. This is important,
otherwise the sauce may curdle. Use the
very best vinegar, as a very little of this will
suffice and prevent the sauce from becoming thin.
Put the yolks of 2 raw eggs in a basin, and add
to them a pinch of salt, ½ a saltspoonful of
white pepper, and ½ a teaspoonful of French
and English mustard in the dry state, and a tiny
pinch of cayenne. Work these together, then
stir in drop by drop 3 gills of olive oil. When
quite thick add ½ a teaspoonful of lemon juice,
and 2 dessertspoonsful of the best vinegar drop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
by drop, and set in a cool place, or on ice, until
required. In case the sauce curdles the yolk of
another egg must be beaten up, and the curdled
sauce added to it little by little.</p>

<h3>Oil and Vinegar Dressing</h3>

<p>Mix 1 saltspoonful of salt and a good pinch of
black pepper with 1 tablespoonful of tarragon
vinegar. Stir until the salt has dissolved, then
add drop by drop 3 tablespoonsful of olive oil.</p>

<p>The other dressings generally used are sauce
tartare, salad dressing and sauce vinaigrette, for
which I give the following excellent recipes:—</p>

<h3>Sauce Tartare</h3>

<p>Chop 1 shallot very fine, with ½ a tablespoonful
of chervil, the same of tarragon, and 12 capers,
also finely minced. Place these ingredients in a
bowl and add ½ a teaspoonful of mustard powder
(English), the yolks of 2 raw eggs, and drop by
drop 1 teaspoonful of vinegar; then a pinch of
salt and ⅓ the quantity of pepper. Pour in by
degrees, stirring all the time, a teacupful of oil.
If too thick add drop by drop a little more
vinegar, and if too salt a little more mustard and
oil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span></p>

<h3>Salad Dressing</h3>

<p>Beat the hard-boiled yolk of 2 eggs with 1 teaspoonful
of dry mustard. When smooth add by
slow degrees 8 dessertspoonsful of oil, 5 of vinegar,
1½ of sugar, and ½ a teacupful of cream. Beat
together with a silver spoon until smooth. If
bottled this dressing will keep for some days.</p>

<h3>Sauce Vinaigrette</h3>

<p>Mince very finely 1 shallot, 2 good sprigs of
parsley and the same quantity of chervil and
chives. Place with them about 1 tablespoonful
of salt, 1 teaspoonful of fresh black pepper and
3 tablespoonsful of vinegar. Stir well together,
add by degrees, stirring all the time, 4 tablespoonsful
of oil.</p>

<p>In salads where chives, onion or garlic are
mentioned, it is best, unless the taste of those
about to partake of the dish is known, to omit
them, and either to rub the salad bowl with onion
or garlic or to prepare what is called a chapon:—</p>

<h3>Chapon</h3>

<p>Cut a neat square of crust from a French loaf,
sprinkle it with salt and rub it with raw onion or
with a clove of garlic. Put this at the bottom of
the salad bowl, place the salad on it and mix
thoroughly. Serve immediately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span></p>

<h3>Vegetable Marrow Salad</h3>

<p>Boil or steam the marrow, drain, and when cold
cut into neat pieces, place in a salad bowl with a
dressing of oil and vinegar.</p>

<h3>Artichoke Salad</h3>

<p>Boil the number of Japanese artichokes required
for 5 minutes, and when cold place in a
salad bowl with slices of cold boiled beetroot and
celery. Cover with mayonnaise sauce. Garnish
with beetroot and celery.</p>

<h3>French Bean Salad</h3>

<p>Boil the beans whole, drain them, and dry
them on a cloth, when quite cold place them in a
bowl and pour over them some salad oil, shake
some black pepper over them and a small amount
of salt, then drop over them a few drops of the
best wine vinegar, and if liked a sprinkling of very
finely-minced tarragon and chives.</p>

<h3>Lettuce Stalk Salad</h3>

<p>Take the stalks from lettuces running to seed,
and tie them in bundles, cutting them more or
less the same size. Place in a saucepan and boil
until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Take out and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
drain them, and allow them to get quite cold.
Then cut up into slices of the same size, place in
a salad bowl and cover with mayonnaise sauce.</p>

<h3>Nut and Celery Salad</h3>

<p>Crack some Brazil nuts and cut the kernels into
3 or 4 pieces. Take an equal quantity of crisp
cleanly-washed and shred celery. Mix together
and dress with mayonnaise sauce. Pile in the
centre of the salad bowl and garnish with sliced
tomato or beetroot.</p>

<h3>Winter Salad</h3>

<p>Scald and then boil one or two large onions till
soft. When cold, slice the onion, mix it with
shred celery and sliced beetroot. Dress with oil,
vinegar, salt and pepper.</p>

<h3>Walnut and Celery Salad,</h3>

<p>which is simply ⅔ celery to ⅓ walnuts tossed in
mayonnaise sauce.</p>

<h3>Russian Salad, No. 1</h3>

<p>Cut up some beetroot into shapes, add to this
a little chopped celery, some turnip, carrot,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
potato, all cooked and cut into dice; pour some
mayonnaise over it all, mix well, and garnish
with bunches of cress. If liked, a French
vinaigrette dressing may be used instead of the
mayonnaise.</p>

<h3>Russian Salad, No. 2</h3>

<p>Cut in thin slices a few small cold steamed
potatoes, 1 small beetroot boiled, 1 small carrot,
a few cold peas or French beans, 1 little pickled
cabbage, 1 sardine filleted and chopped fine.
Mix all well together. Rub the salad bowl with
onion. For the dressing take a teaspoonful each
of raw mustard and salt, a little coralline pepper,
a pinch of curry powder, ½ a wineglass of sherry
and the same of Lucca oil. Mix all well together
and pour over the salad.</p>

<h3>Haricot Bean Salad</h3>

<p>Soak the haricots for 6 or 8 hours and then boil
them until tender. Leave until cold. Pile them
in the centre of a salad bowl and surround with
shred tomato or beetroot and some shred celery.
Cover with whipped cream flavoured with salt
and white pepper. If liked dip the haricot in oil
and vinegar in addition to the cream. Decorate
the cream with a little coralline pepper, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
arrange the beetroot so that it makes a red
border to the white pyramid of cream.</p>

<h3>Salade d’Estrées</h3>

<p>Take some cold boiled roots of celeriac, some
cold potatoes and beetroot. In the middle of the
salad bowl make a heap of endive and blanched
celery stalks, frizzed, in short lengths. Surround
with the vegetables sliced. Pour over the
whole a good mayonnaise sauce.</p>

<h3>Garnished Salad, with Imperial Mayonnaise</h3>

<p>Pound and press through a sieve 4 large
anchovies (no bones), boil 6 eggs hard, halve
them and neatly remove the yolks, which pound
to a paste with butter, the powdered anchovies,
¼ teaspoonful of mace, a little pepper. Mix well,
and roughly fill the egg cases. Fill almost to the
top the salad bowl with finely-shred lettuce,
endive, cooked beetroot, sliced (very thin) artichoke
(cooked), and finally add some cucumber
ribbons. Then arrange with care the egg baskets
and pour round, but not over the halved eggs, the
following dressing (imperial mayonnaise):—Put
into a basin ½ pint of aspic, and add 1 tablespoonful
of olive oil, 2 teaspoonsful of vinegar, and a
trifle of salt and pepper. Beat with an egg
whisk until all the ingredients are well blended.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
Set the salad in a pan of ice water if possible, or
in a very cold place until served.</p>

<h3>Celery Salad</h3>

<p>Wash some fresh crisp celery and use only the
inner sticks. Cut it in ½ inch lengths, place in
a salad bowl which has been rubbed with onion
and dress with mayonnaise sauce. Decorate with
a little chopped truffle.</p>

<h3>Salade d’Asperges à la d’Aumale</h3>

<p>This is a way of using cold cooked asparagus
with mousseline sauce. Put ½ gill of new milk
into a pan with the yolks of 4 eggs, and 3 crushed
long peppercorns; place this all in a bainmarie,
or larger stewpan, half filled with boiling water,
and whisk it all together well for a few minutes;
now add 1 oz. of butter, adding it bit by bit, and
only putting in another piece when the first is
thoroughly melted and worked in. Season it as
you whisk with a dust of salt and nutmeg, and a
tiny squeeze of lemon juice at the last. When it
is finished this sauce should look like frothed
cream.</p>

<p>Another salad which is suitable for hot
weather is</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span></p>

<h3>Lettuce and Tomato Salad</h3>

<p>For this proceed exactly as for a plain lettuce
salad, but add a ring of fresh tomato, peeled, and
not too thinly sliced.</p>

<p>Other nice salads are—</p>

<h3>French Tomato Salad</h3>

<p>Take 6 ripe, sound tomatoes, wipe them, and
place them in boiling water for a minute; drain,
peel, let them cool, quarter them (this should be
done while they are in the salad bowl, so that the
juice is not wasted); add a teaspoonful of finely-chopped
chives or a chapon; dress with oil and
vinegar.</p>

<h3>Tomato and Egg Salad</h3>

<p>Proceed as before, but to each tomato add ½
a hard-boiled egg, quartered, and dress with
mayonnaise sauce.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
